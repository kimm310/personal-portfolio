### Tools used

This project was initially created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/). For styling, I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/). For the fade-in and fade-out animations, I use [animate.css](https://animate.style/).
For the backend, I use Node, Express, CORS and Nodemailer.
